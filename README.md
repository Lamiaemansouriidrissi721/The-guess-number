Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

This project is a command-line number guessing game built in Python. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 within a set number of attempts, depending on the selected difficulty level.
Purpose

    Practice Python control flow, input handling, and random number generation.
    Create a simple and interactive game to improve programming skills while having fun.
    Demonstrate the use of conditional logic and loops in a real-world application.

How It Works

    The game randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.
    Players choose a difficulty level:
        Easy Mode: 10 attempts to guess the number.
        Hard Mode: 5 attempts to guess the number.
    Players receive feedback after each guess:
        Whether their guess was too high or too low.
        If their guess is very close to the actual number (within a threshold of 2).
    The game ends when:
        The player guesses the correct number.
        The player runs out of attempts.

Features

    Difficulty Levels: Easy and hard modes with varying numbers of attempts.
    Feedback System: Players are informed if they are close to the target number.
    Random Number Generation: Ensures a different experience every time the game is played.
    User-Friendly Interface: Clear instructions and prompts guide the player.
